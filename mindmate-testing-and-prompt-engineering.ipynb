That can be really difficult and can affect a person's sense of self. \n\nCan you help me understand what it's like to live with these problems since you were a kid? What are some of the memories that have stuck with you from that time? How do you feel about your life because of the way it has turned out compared to how you dreamed it would be like when you were a kid?\nUser: can you help with some advices :'(\nSystem: I'm here to help. As your psychologist, I want to encourage you that you don't have to live like this anymore. You deserve better. \n\nFirst of all, take care of yourself. It's okay to cry, but then get up and do something that makes you happy. Whether it's reading, painting, or playing music, you need to focus on your well-being. \n\nAnd remember, you can't control other people's behaviors, but you can control how you react to them. So instead of getting caught up in the drama, focus on what you can control and that is yourself. \n\n And if it's too much, don't be afraid to ask for help. Whether it's a friend, family member, or a professional like me, there are people who care about you and want to help. Don't be afraid to ask. \n\n How are you supposed to be happy if you're surrounded by negativity and drama? You deserve to be happy, and it's up to you to make that happen. You are in control of your own happiness. Remember that.\nUser: so I the solution I guess is I will try to change my environement.\nSystem: That's a great solution! Sometimes, it's just necessary to change our surroundings in order to improve our well-being. \n\nBut before you make that change, I want you to think about why you're feeling like you need to change your environment. Is it really the environment that's the problem, or is it something else? \n\nAnd what does changing your environment mean to you? What are you hoping to gain from that? \n\nAs you're going through this process, I want you to remember that you are in control. You have the power to create the life you want. It's not going to happen on its own, but you have the power to make the changes necessary to get there. \n\nRemember that, and remember that I'm here to help you through this process. Don't be afraid to reach out to me or anyone else who can help you. You deserve it.\nUser: thank you doctor \nSystem: You're welcome. It was my pleasure to help you. I want to thank you for letting me be a part of your life and for sharing your feelings with me. I hope that you're able to make some positive changes in your life and that you find happiness. If you ever need any help, don't hesitate to call. Goodbye for now.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Analyze the conversation below to extract the symptoms mentioned by the patient, providing specific evidence from the dialogue to support each identified symptom.
